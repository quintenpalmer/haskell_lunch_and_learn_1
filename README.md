Project to demo basics of Programming in Haskell.

To run:
 - Install stack from https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack#how-to-install
 - Run `stack build` (this should pull in the dependencies and then build the source code)
 - Run either of the executables produced in the directory: `.stack-work/install/*/*/*/bin/`
 - I was running
 -- `stack build && .stack-work/install/*/*/*/bin/worker-example`
 -- `stack build && .stack-work/install/*/*/*/bin/landl-example`
